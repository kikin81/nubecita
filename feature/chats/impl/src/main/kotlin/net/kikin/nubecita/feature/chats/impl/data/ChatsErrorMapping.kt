 * on the message substring because the appview's error code is
 * generic — multiple distinct conditions all return InvalidRequest.
 *
 * If Bluesky changes the wording, this match needs to update; we treat
 * any miss as a generic `Unknown` error, which is a safe failure mode
 * (Retry button still rendered).
